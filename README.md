To run it in the browser, clone the repo and run the command `ionic serve --lab` to view it with a side by side iOS and Android view. If you're new to Ionic and Firebase, check out these resources to get started:

* [Ionic Documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/)
* [AngularFire Documentation](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/)
* [Firebase Web Quickstart](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/quickstart.html)
